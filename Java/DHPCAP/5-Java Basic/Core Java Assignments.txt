Day 1
1. Refer to "Installation Instructions" from day1-data\day1_help & complete.

2. MUST go through "readme_day1"  from day1-data\day1_help\readmes & day1-data\day1_help\slides\PPTDay1.pdf

3. Go through simple code samples from day1-data\code\src

4. Solve 
1. Accept 2 double values from User (using Scanner). Check data type.
. If arguments are not doubles , supply suitable error message & terminate.
If numbers are double values , print its average.

2. Display food menu to user. User will select items from menu along with the quantity. (eg 1. Dosa 2. Samosa .......10 . Generate Bill ) Assign fixed prices to food items(hard code the prices)
When user enters 'Generate Bill' option(10) , display total bill & exit.

OR 
Create java application for the following
Accept 2 numbers from user & operation to perform
1. Add 2.Subtract 3. Multiply 4.Divide 5.Exit
Display the result of the operation. 
Java app must continue to run till user chooses exit option.

OR
Prompt user for how many numbers(double) to accept
Create suitable data structure to hold these numbers.
Prompt user to populate the values in D.S
Display the same.
Prompt user for option
1. Double nums
2. Square nums
3. Square root nums
As per the option , apply this operation on all nums in the D.S
display the same.


Day2
1. Do complete revision of class work & then solve today's assignemnts

2. 
Solve Tank assignment along with memory picture.

What will be the output ?

class Tank {
  private int level;
  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }
  public int getLevel()
  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
     s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//10 20
    t1 = t2;//1st tank obj is marked GC
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//20 20
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//27 27
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//37 37
  }
}

2.5 Solve ready code samples from : day2_data\day2_help\params_passing\
TestParamPassing1 & TestParamPassing2

3. Solve
Create Point class Point2D   : for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

3.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.


3.2 Add a method to return string form of  point's x & y co-ords
Hint :  public String getDetails()) 


3.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.


3.4 Add a method to Point2D class -- to create and return new point having given x & y offset.
eg : Point2D p1=new Point2D(10,20);
Point2d p3=p1.createNewPoint(5,-2);
If user supplies offset of (5, -2) : your method should return a new point object placed at (15,18)


3.5 Add calculateDistance method to calculate distance between current point & specified point & return the distance to the caller.
Hint : Use distance formula . Use java.lang.Math class methods --sqrt, pow etc.
double calcDistance(Point2D anotherPointRef)
{
}

3.6 Write TestPoint class ,  with a main method
Accept co ordinates of 2 points from user (Scanner) --p1 & p2

3.7 Use getDetails method to display point details.(p1's details & p2's details)

3.8 Invoke isEqual & display if points are same or different (i.e p1 & p2 are located at the same position)

3.9 Create new point p3 , with the dimensions offset from p1.

Day 3

1. Revise entire class work.

1.1 Import eclipse project day3.1 in your workspace

Solve this
Double box width for all boxes having volume > 100.(USE for-each & solve this : for understnding for-each clearly)


1.5 Solve this without IDE pls.
Copy earlier created Point2D class  n place it under the package "com.geometry"
Copy earlier created TestPoint class n place it under "tester" package.
Solve compiler errors n run it without IDE , w/o setting classpath
Then set CLASSPATH , so that you can run it from anywhere



2. Solve
Create new eclipse project "day3_assgnment"
Copy Point2D class n TestPoints class along with the packages in IDE.

2.1 Create a new tester in package "com.tester" : TestPointArray
 Prompt user , how many points to plot?
Create suitable data structure  , to store Point2D type of references.
eg : Point2D[] points=new Point2D[sc.nextInt()];//10

2.2 Add a menu , Run the application till user chooses option 10 (exit)

1 Plot a new point
I/P --index , x & y
eg : If user supplies 5 50 100
Create a Point2D with x, y of (50,100) & its reference should be stored at the 5th index position in array.
eg : if (index < .... && points[index] == null)
         points[index] =new Point2D(....);
       else
         sop("point plotting error!!!!!");

2 Display all points plotted so far. (Use for-each)
Q : is null checking required ? 
for (Point2D p : points)
    sop(p);

3. Test equality of 2 points
I/P : index1 , index 2
eg If user enters 1 7 , you have to check if point at 1st n 7th index is same.
If same , print "SAME" , otherwise print "DIFFERENT"

4. Calculate distance
I/P strt , end point indexes.
eg : If user enters 2 6
Find out the distance between 2nd & 6th point. (array indexes start from 0)

10. Exit

Note : Boundary condition checking & null checking is expected.
(Meaning : if user supplies invalid index , then give error message : invalid index --out of range
If no point is plotted at user specified index , then give error message : invalid index -- no point plotted here.)

Day 4
1. Import day4.1 in your workspace.
Through today's code samples : try to understand points below
1.0 static keyword & it's usages
1.1 Do complete revision of constructor invocation in the inheritance hierarchy
1.2 Revise from javadocs , Object class's toString method.
What does it return ?
1.3 What is the need of overriding(modifying) toString ?
1.4 How do you do it ?
1.5 What's upcasting & where do you need it ?
1.6 Example of run time polymorphism (in Test2 & Test3 from "tester" package) 

2. Complete pending work.

3.Optional assignment(if time permits!)

Create basket of fruits . Prompt user for the capacity of the basket.

Available fruits are 
Apple (sweet n sour in taste)
Mango (sweet)
Orange (sour)

Allow user to add any fruit dynamically in the basket.
User should be able to display the name of the fruit & taste , for all the fruits added in the basket.
Hint : name : data member
taste() : a method


Day 5
1. Revise complete class work(import day5.1 , day5.2 , day 5.3)

2. Apply inheritance , polymorphism & abstraction to emp based organization scenario.

Create Emp based organization structure --- Emp , Mgr , Worker
All of above classes must be in package--com.app.org

2.1 Emp state--- id(int), name, deptId(string) , basic(double)

Behaviour ---1.  get emp details -- use toString.
2. compute net salary ---
eg : public double computeNetSalary()

2.2 Mgr state  ---id,name,basic,deptId , perfmonceBonus
Behaviour ----1. get mgr details :  override toString. 
2. compute net salary (formula: basic+performanceBonus) 
3. get performance bonus. --add a new method to return bonus.(getter)


2.3 Worker state  --id,name,basic,deptId,hoursWorked,hourlyRate
Behaviour--- 
1. get worker details -- :  override toString.
2.  compute net salary (formula:  = basic+(hoursWorked*hourlyRate) --override computeNetSalary
3. get hrlyRate of the worker  -- add a new method to return hourly rate of a worker.(getter)

Can you organize these classes in inheritance  hierarchy.

2.4 Write TestOrganization in "tester" package.
Create suitable data structure  to store organization details.

Provide following options. Run the application till "exit"

1. Hire Manager

2. Hire Worker  

3. Display information of all employees including net salary  using single for-each loop.
Display from the same for-each loop, performance bonus if it's a manager or if it's a worker , display hourly rate of the worker .

4. Update performanceBonus or hourly rate
I/P : emp id , bonus or hourly rate increment
Update the details suitably.

5. Exit


3. Solve ready code samples . (w/o IDE : guess what will happen?)
