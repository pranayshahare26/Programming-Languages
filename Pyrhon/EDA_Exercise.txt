Is there a correlation between a country's happiness score and its level of freedom? Create a scatter plot to explore this relationship.
Are there any outliers or unusual trends in the data? Create a box plot or violin plot to identify any significant differences in happiness scores by region or factor.
How does the distribution of happiness scores compare between different regions? Create a histogram or density plot for each region to compare the shape of their distributions.
Are there any significant changes in the rankings of countries between years? Create a bubble chart to display the changes in rank over time.
How do the happiness scores vary within each country? Create a choropleth map to show the distribution of happiness scores across different regions within each country.
